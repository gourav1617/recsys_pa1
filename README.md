# Practical Assignment 1 - RecSys

This repository contains my solution to the first practical assignment of Recommender Systems class of Departamento de Ciência da Computação - Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

The solution uses Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Techniques with mean centering normalization and cosine similarity.

If you have to develop a similar assignment **do not** use this job as if you were the author, plagiarism is a very bad practice. You can use the code/documentation to get insights into your problem.
